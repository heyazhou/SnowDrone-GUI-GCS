## Introduction

A LabVIEW project was constructed in order to unify the subsystems on the SnowDrone. A specific producer/consumer event driven architecture was chosen to facilitate the addition of more subsystems. This readme file explains to future students how the LabVIEW project operates, how to interface with and add more components, hardware considerations, as well as system architecture. 

## Completed Subsystems
The subsystems that have been successfully integrated are the following: GPS, Actuator, Throttle control, Temperature and fan control. a short description and visuals for each completed subsystem are described below.
